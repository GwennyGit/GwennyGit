## 👋🏻 Greetings

### :brain: About me:

My name is Gwendolyn Olivia Döbel. I am a research assistant in Bioinformatics and Data Analytics at the Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg. Before that, I was a research assistant in  Computational Systems Biology of Infections and Antimicrobial-Resistant Pathogens at the Eberhard Karl University Tübingen.<br>
I studied Biology for my bachelor's degree and Bioinformatics for my master's degree at the Eberhard Karl University Tübingen. The topic of my master thesis is the ‘Reconstruction of strain-specific metabolic models of _Staphylococcus haemolyticus_’.<br>
During my first and second research assistant position, I have and will continue to work on the strain-specific metabolic models of _Staphylococcus haemolyticus_ and the tool [`refineGEMs`](https://github.com/draeger-lab/refinegems) which I already extended during my master thesis.<br>
