## 👋🏻 Greetings

### :brain: About me:

My name is Gwendolyn Olivia Gusak. I am a research assistant in Computational Systems Biology of Infections and Antimicrobial-Resistant Pathogens at the University of Tübingen. Before that, I was a master’s student in Bioinformatics at the same University.<br>
The topic of my master thesis is the ‘Reconstruction of strain-specific metabolic models of _Staphylococcus haemolyticus_’. <br>
During my research assistant position, I will continue to work on the strain-specific metabolic models of _Staphylococcus haemolyticus_ and the tool refineGEMs I already extended during my master thesis.
